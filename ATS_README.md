# Hi, I’m Shakal Bhau 👋  
### Cybersecurity Learner | Secure Application Developer

I am a cybersecurity beginner with hands-on project experience in ethical hacking tools, secure coding, and data protection concepts.  
My focus is on learning by building, understanding how attacks work, and how systems can be secured in practice.

I am actively looking for internship / entry-level opportunities where I can grow under mentorship and contribute responsibly.

## 📝 Professional Note

All projects are built for learning and ethical purposes only.  
I do not engage in unauthorized testing or misuse of security tools.

I believe strong security starts with understanding systems deeply,  
writing clean code, and respecting ethical boundaries.
