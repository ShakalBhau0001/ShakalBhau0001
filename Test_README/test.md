# Hi, I’m Shakalen Nabilal Shaikh 👋  
### Security-Focused Developer | Cybersecurity Learner

I build **security-oriented applications and learning projects** to understand how systems break — and how they can be secured correctly.
My approach is **learning by building**, experimenting in ethical lab environments, and improving code quality, security awareness, and system design step by step.
I’m currently seeking **internship or entry-level opportunities** where I can grow under mentorship and contribute responsibly.
