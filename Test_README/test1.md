# Hi, I’m Shakalen Nabilal Shaikh 👋  
### Cybersecurity Learner | Secure Application Development Enthusiast

I am a cybersecurity learner with hands-on experience building **learning-focused projects** around secure coding, authentication systems, and data protection concepts.  
My approach is practical — understanding **how systems work**, **how vulnerabilities arise**, and **how security can be applied responsibly**.

I am currently developing my skills through self-study, labs, and real projects, and I am open to **internship or entry-level opportunities** where I can learn under guidance and contribute meaningfully.
