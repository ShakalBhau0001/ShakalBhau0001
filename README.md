# Hi, I’m Shakalen Nabilal Shaikh 👋  
### Cybersecurity & Secure Application Development

Focused on building secure, authentication-driven web applications while strengthening practical cybersecurity fundamentals.

I build learning-focused projects to understand how real systems are attacked and secured. I actively practice secure coding, backend development, and vulnerability awareness through hands-on projects and cybersecurity labs.  
Currently seeking internship / entry-level opportunities where I can grow under mentorship and contribute responsibly.
